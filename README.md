# BADGR Training
This code repo is for the implementation of the training of the BADGR model (https://github.com/gkahn13/badgr) on the bumpy dataset. 

Please refer to the BADGR_training_notebook.ipynb file for more detailed description of the process and code implemented.

The same notebook file also includes a discussion on how the algorithm can be integrated with cloud computing and lifelong learning.
